## My Website

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/projects/homepage.png" | absolute_url }}" alt=""/></span>

With this I am experimenting with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's my first website I build using a static site generator like jekyll is.

While I'm quite familiar with the web and webdesign, I'm not really good at designing good looking pages. This page is based on a template named
[Massively](https://html5up.net/massively) which was provided by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

For deployment I'm, using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The source code for this page is hosted on Github. Every time I push on the `master` branch
of this website's repository, a build is triggered and the generated HTML files are automatically deployed on my server.
