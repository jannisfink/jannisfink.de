I build my homepage using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Previously, I have been experimenting with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). For many people, jekyll seems to be the static site generator of choice, so when I wanted to create my personal homepage using such a tool, jekyll seemed to be the logical choice.

I went through two (:rofl:!) iterations of my homepage design and finally settled for the design pictured below, but was never truly happy, mainly because of my inability to design something that I would find beautiful. At that time, I already came across several other static site generators, with Hugo being the one alternative I wanted to try first. I was not unsatisfied with jekyll itself, but wanted to try something else nevertheless. I may outline my reasoning in a future blog post.

When I ported my homepage to Hugo, I started from scratch and did not port the theme, but instead opted for one that already existed, [Personal Web](https://themes.gohugo.io/personal-web/). The whole process of porting everything was done in one day, with the result being this webpage.
