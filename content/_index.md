Hey,

I am Jannis Fink, a software engineer working in Bremen, Germany.
In 2013, I started my training as an IT specialist for application development at a software company in Bremen.
Since then, I've finished my bachelor in computer science, too, and are currently working on my master degree.

The main focus of my current work are web applications.
I've spend the past ~8+ years building various ones for work and private projects.
Some of them are [showcased here](/portfolio).
