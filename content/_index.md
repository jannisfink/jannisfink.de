Hey,

I am Jannis Fink, a software engineer working in Bremen, Germany.
I started programming during programming class as well as during some internships while I was in school.
After graduating school, I started working as a trainee in a software company in Bremen while going to university at the same time.
This form of education is known as ["Duales Studium"](http://dualesstudiuminformatik.de/) here in Germany.

The main focus of my current work are web applications.
I've spend the past ~8+ years building various ones for work and private projects.
I have some of them [showcased here](/portfolio).
