Over the past several years, I have worked on several different projects. This page lists some of them.

### Current projects

#### [My website](/projects/website)

[My website](/projects/website) is a small project of mine.
It used to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a site generator and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for deployment, but has been migrated to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the site generation and [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) for deployment.

<!-- #### Suluvir

A self hosted music streaming server I am currently developing using Googles [Go language](https://golang.org). Source code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/suluvir/server). -->

### Past projects

#### [LaKKT](/projects/lakkt)

[LaKKT](/projects/lakkt) was an analysis tool for the strategy game [Lords & Knights](https://lordsandknights.com/).
