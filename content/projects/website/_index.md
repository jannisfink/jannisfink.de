With this I am experimenting with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's my first website I build using a static site generator like jekyll is.

The design I have developed by myself. It's this simple mainly because of two reasons:

1. I like it this way
1. I'm not that good at designing stuff that is visually appealing

For deployment, I'm using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The source code for this page is hosted on Github. Every time I push on the `master` branch
of this website's repository, a build is triggered and the generated HTML files are automatically deployed on my server.
