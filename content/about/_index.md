I do programming for a living. It all started with some internships while I was in school. After graduating school, I started
working as a trainee in a software company in Germany while going to university at the same time. This form of education is known
as ["Duales Studium"](http://dualesstudiuminformatik.de/) here in Germany.

The main focus of my current work is the web. I've spend the past ~8+ years building various web applications for work and
private projects. I have some of them [showcased here](/projects).
