## About me

I do programming for a living. It all started with some internships while I was in school. After graduating school, I started
working as a trainee in a software company in Germany while going to university at the same time. This form of education is known
as ["Duales Studium"](http://dualesstudiuminformatik.de/) here in Germany.

My main focus of my current work is the web. I've spend the past ~5+ years building various web applications for work and
private projects. I will showcase some of them in the near future on this site.

When I'm not working on the computer, I love to row, dance (standard) or read a book amongst various other things.
